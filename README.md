# LAHacks2017
At LA Hacks 2017, I created a potential website for the 2024 Olympics which would help enhance the fan experience.
Before coming to LA Hacks, I had no prior experience with web development, but I wanted to learn more about it.
With my experiences here, I was able to create a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and some APIs as well. 
I am thankful for the people at Hack Camp and the mentors who had helped me along the way. 
Thank you so much and I really appreciate all the help!
